	Implemented Gas Sensor: MQ-4, Gives range between 150-400 at room levels, increases the intensity if it detects 	perfume alchohol or smoke. 

20th July, 2023
	Fixed the MQ4 Code and circuit. The threshold is 500 ppm, if it gets greater than 500, the buzzer starts beeping and it displays that gas has been detected.

	Implementation of DHT22(AM2302), DHT22 can measure temperatures from -40 degrees Centigrade to 125 degrees centigrade with and accuracy of +-0.5
	DHT22 sensor can measure relative humidity from 0 to 100% with an accuracy of 2-5%
	Observations: Changes the temperature when taken outside the room, gave an increase of 5 unit, however, when it was brought back inside the it took a long time
		      to adjust to room temperature. In case of humidity, it increased when the circuit was taken outside.
