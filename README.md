# Arduino Environment Sensor Integration

This repository showcases the integration of various sensors into Arduino projects, focusing on environmental monitoring. It includes support for the following sensors:

- **MQ-4 Gas Sensor:** Detects gases like methane, with adjustable threshold and buzzer feedback.
- **DHT22 (AM2302):** Measures humidity and temperature accurately, suitable for various environments.
- **BME280:** Measures pressure, temperature, altitude, and humidity, ideal for comprehensive environmental data.
- **DS18B20 Waterproof Sensor:** Monitors temperature of water and soil, useful for ecological and agricultural studies.

The project's modular code structure makes it easy to incorporate additional sensors, perfect for customizing Arduino-based environmental solutions. Whether you're into DIY projects, education, or research, this repository provides a solid foundation to start from.
